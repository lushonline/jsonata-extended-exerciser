# JSONata Extended Exerciser

This allows you to test JSONata expressions against a JSON input.

In the top editor panes you can enter your JSONata expression, and any [bindings](https://docs.jsonata.org/embedding-extending#expressionevaluateinput-bindings-callback) you wish to include.

In the botton editor panes you can supply your source JSON and see the results.

On the topmenu bar you can select from the same four examples available at [try.jsonata.org](http://try.jsonata.org/)
